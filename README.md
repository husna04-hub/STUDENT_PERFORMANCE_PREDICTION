# STUDENT_PERFORMANCE_PREDICTION
# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts students' final academic performance using demographic, family, and academic features. The goal is to identify key factors affecting student grades and build a regression model for prediction.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains student attributes such as:
- Age, gender, family background
- Study time, failures, alcohol consumption
- Previous grades (G1, G2)
- Final grade (G3)

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Encoding categorical features
3. Train-test split
4. Model training using Random Forest Regression
5. Model evaluation using R², RMSE, and MSE
6. Feature importance analysis and visualization

## 📈 Results
- **R² Score:** 0.82  
- **RMSE:** 1.90  
- **MSE:** 3.62  

The model explains 82% of the variance in student performance with an average prediction error of ±2 marks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab
